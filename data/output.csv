32,2022-11-29,06:50:14," gt like, i m sorry to tell you but you re never gonna debatebro white supremacy capitalism etc... to death. you re presupposing altruism from non altruistic actors. well it beats provoking and fighting against a unwinnable quagmire. gt you don t need a genocide to defeat an opposing ideology usually killing off or at the very least removing them from the picture whoever the ideologues rally around and preventing new ones from emerging by changing the material conditions that led to said ideology emerging e.g. in the afghan exemple by not being an imperial power that goes around raping, murdering and pillaging is more than enough to cause it to kinda vanish. wow, you went mask off supporting mass killing of people who oppose leftism. political cleansing or politicide is a violation of international law such as the geneva convention , and a catalyst for the type of armed conflicts that i m describing, let alone immoral. not to mention it s already been attempted many times before and it failed. for example, after the saur revolution, the communist government attempt to kill ideas, by either jailing or executing any dissent and opposition in afghanistan. instead of the targeted ideas being exterminated, they got a guerrilla resistance of people who held said ideas and lost to them. it sounds like changing the material conditions may be at odds with civil liberties and even international law. further, leftists seem to have a hard time trying to understand how their actions can radicalize people against them, including intolerance against certain ideas. y know the material conditions you re talking about? like for example, germany has outlawed the nazisim, yet despite this, nazism still exists far from eradicated and this can be the result of germany repressing any political dissent opposition and the double standard treatment they give. in other words, despite germany s best attempts, neo nazism is still a thing, and the german government s intolerance of political dissent is partly to blame. gt quick question, do you think the nuremberg trials were immoral too? should the nazis just have been handed power back with just a slap on the wrist which, to be honest is basically what happened, but eh, details... apparently leftists can t tell the difference between a person teaching his dog to nazi salute, and an actual case of antisemitic mass murder. it s a fallacy to equate people who say pro nazi speech and those who actually commit murder in the name of nazism. did firing iraqis who supported or worked for saddam hussein, really make things better for iraq? or did it result in the years long period of insurgent terrorist violence that plagued the country, until a compromise was made with the baathists and other insurgent groups? gt like, you know let s not genocide people , for example, which, you know, happens to be a pretty common position with the opposition, either implicitly or explicitly. like, whole of the liberal to fascism spectrum common. the problem here, is that this is a leftist strawman of the rightist talking points. and that s largely due to many leftists illogically believing that all rightists are nazis which is the left wing equivalent of all muslims are terrorists . with the more moderate or even alt lite rightists, it s not even about intolerance of the intolerant more like deeming tolerable ideas as intolerant . how does keeping ar15s legal, protecting against drug cartels, and defending the right to offend, lead to a jewish holocaust 2.0? to get a little off topic, dark or edgy humor has been around long before the nazis even appeared, yet evidence claiming that edgy humor leads to bigotry, fascism, or atrocities is only as good as, the evidence for video games lead to violence. how does a joke about nazis involving a pug doing a nazi salute, lead to the fourth reich taking power? this is starting a lot less like defeating intolerance and more like freedom from criticism, opposition, offense and even ridicule . gt like, get real, the black panthers were completely obliterated, you don t see many black liberation movements upholding mlm mzt around, do you? and blm is very clearly not that. the iww is mostly a lethargic corpse. ideologies can see a revival, but this obviously implies a death beforehand, doesn t it? this almost seems like shifting goal posts, since you went from ideas can be killed to ideas can be driven out relevancy . black panthers may be small, but they still exist and are growing. then of course islamic fundementalism, which still exists even in the us, the worst they can do is say lgbt is haram . neverless ideas, can t be killed. maybe transform or adapt, but not killed. do you honestly think that the nazis or even the ww1 empires invented fascism? gt well, at least your answer to the should violence against minorities be tolerated is clear. like i said it s a typical leftist strawman argument, misrepresnting rightist talking points. plus, many leftists would consider edgy but harmless, jokes as violent speech against minorites . there s a difference a neo nazi legit calling for violence, and cartman making fun of jewish people the formerly is a legit, while the latter is at worst grossly offensive, but harmless. and there s even a bigger difference between actions and speech, a concept too difficult for the left aparrently. supressing the intolerant with brute force and intolerance, will backfire, just like it did when it came to fighting the taliban. you d only be replacing material conditions and creating new greivances and justifications for extremist violence. it would seem that you re too blind by statist idealism, that is far more unrealistic than the liberal idealism.",reddit,2022-11-30 13:07:53.800685

the representatives of the bourgeoisie understand that for the sake of overthrowing negro slavery, of overthrowing the rule of the slaveowners, it was worth letting the country go through long years of civil war, through the abysmal ruin, destruction and terror that accompany every war. but now, when we are confronted with the vastly greater task of overthrowing capitalist wage slavery, of overthrowing the rule of the bourgeoisie now, the representatives and defenders of the bourgeoisie, and also the reformist socialists who have been frightened by the bourgeoisie and are shunning the revolution, cannot and do not want to understand that civil war is necessary and legitimate. https www.marxists.org archive lenin works 1918 aug 20.htm mao mao praising the american revolution, the civil war, george washington and abraham lincoln during an interview with edgar snow in 1965 the united states, he said, had first fought a progressive war of independence from british imperialism, and then fought a civil war to establish a free labour market. washington and lincoln were progressive men of their time. when the united states first established a republic it was hated and dreaded by all the crowned heads of europe. that showed that the americans were then revolutionaries. now the american people needed to struggle for liberation from their own monopoly capitalists. https www.marxists.org reference archive mao selected works volume 9 appendix.htm",reddit,2022-11-30 13:07:53.800685

547,2022-11-29,03:46:35," gt it s less about defending qatar and more about the asymmetry in how qatar has been criticised compared to other sporting event hosts. take last world cup in russia, it was after the annexation of crimea, plenty of issues related to freedom of press, lgbt etc yet there was no where near this level of coverage. i agree. there is an asymmetry. the warning voices were definitely there, but they didn t go nearly as far as in qatar s case. i don t think boycotting the whole thing was ever seriously brought up. and the public was also largely oblivious about just how shitty russia is as a country, in some regards. however, i will say that having a large diaspora in the western world, and apparently not having treated their workers like slaves something that supposedly happened in qatar , certainly helped with presenting russia as a host nation in a more favourable light. a public german tv broadcaster even had a series where a guest host with russian roots travelled through russia to present country and people. i think i remember that there were critical segments as well, highlighting poverty and injustice and such, but that wasn t the core content. unthinkable that they would do something like that now, after russia s attack on ukraine. but people seemingly didn t want to think about crimea and mh17 back then, even though it had been just 4 years. gt the other point is the hypocrisy of the west taking moral positions when the wars in the middle east have led to millions dead and many tens of millions more displaced. it s almost like they only care about brown people when there s a moral agenda. okay, i don t think it s fair to assume this about every westerner. for example, i don t really care about a moral agenda , i care about not treating women like shit, among other things. and the west cough usa cough has some way to go in that regard still. but not nearly as far as other countries, like qatar. gt no sporting event that i can remember has received anywhere near the level of hate qatar gets. i don t have a problem with the hate, but be consistent. maybe because not every host nation is like qatar, and deserves the same treatment? also, brazil received plenty of criticism, for example for shit like building a large stadium in the middle of nowhere manaus . and and least in my country, as a result of the debates about qatar, many were reminded just how inactive and morally bankrupt the german football association had acted back in 78, when the world cup took place in argentina while a military junta was terrorizing their own population. meanwhile, the german team recorded a kitschy song https youtu.be ozv52nng6um . doesn t get much sadder than that. gt whenever these points are made we get accused of whataboutery as though any comparison must be perfectly analogous. well, it can come across as disingenuous. and frankly, some comparisons are kinda invalid. it is what it is. gt i can t help but feel for most people it s racism disguised as virtue, simply because they don t apply that moral standard consistently. again, extremely unfair to simply assume this about everyone. and yes, i also absolutely hated the decision to let russia host a wc.",reddit,2022-11-30 13:07:53.800685

656,2022-11-29,03:14:09," gt yeeeah... this reminds me of a feminist sect in india i think? that was like.. against redefining rape in a way that recognized rape against men by women, because they felt it would undermine the seriousness of rape as a women s issue. oh boy. haven t heard of that one before, but i ve seen similar suggestions in western countries. one thing i ll never forget was a video of a board of mostly female feminist politicians and civil servants in the uk i think? i m not british openly laughing about the notion of creating a domestic abuse shelter specifically for men of which there are virtually none, anywhere . i couldn t find the video but my googling led me to this article https www.feministcurrent.com 2020 09 13 protecting men at the womens shelter instead which i think perfectly encapsulates the misandry among many feminists which simply isn t addressed by the mainstream left, or at least not sufficiently. what do i mean? if you read this through a na ve, run of the mill, western feminist lense, the article probably sounds reasonable. well, i happen to find it pretty gross actually. the author bitches i m choosing this word consciously p about men in women s shelters without trying to view them as human beings a single time in the entire article. she doesn t find it dehumanizing or even wastes a single thought on how humiliating it is that men are only allowed in this shelter if they identify as women, many even changing their names and pronouns. she doesn t consider a single time that maybe some of the men who caused troubles were simply stressed out and didn t get the support they needed. they simply caused troubles cause they were men, i assume. she even goes so far to complain about and mock the notion that the men at the shelter aren t being heard and aren t getting the support they need. she probably thinks of them as animals who can t behave civilized. this becomes even more apparent after she admits that many women at the shelter are also causing troubles and are being nasty to other people in the shelter. but unlike the men, these women are human and therefore display the whole range of human behaviour from good to bad. no such paragraph for the men in the article.. even tho she explicitly states in the beginning that the majority of the men in the shelter are behaving lovely and not causing problems. it s almost as if we are all just humans p finally, throughout the entire thing, not once does she come to the sensible conclusion which would be the demand for men s shelters so they don t have to resort to going to women s shelters. she doesn t even find it strange that this is necessary to begin with. she doesn t see or acknowledge how the world treats men as completely disposable. instead, she of course comes to the conclusion that women are victims and men are the culprits gt as women in a men s world, we should know this much, if nothing else there is safety nowhere. not for us. sorry this has been a bit long, but this sort of stuff is omnipresent and i think society at large and the vast majority of feminist and leftist circles have never even started to critically question the way they talk about men the same way they started questioning their language on women. we re at ground zero of a pretty big societal problem imho and i ve seen this being ignored and belittled for over a decade now. i ve always been and always will be on the left, and i dare say i m a much better leftist than all of the people willfully ignoring this issue or actively denying it s real. but if there s ever been a moment of doubt in my mind particularly in my early 20s when i questioned if the left really has good intentions for me as a person, it s always been because of the vitriol against and neglect of men. gt i always wonder how much power there is in those groups as well though? is the larger feminist movement against that? again it s tricky because it s not a monolith so it s easy to point at a given segment s faults. i would hope intersectional feminism is becoming more a thing .. ? imho it s easy to find out. around here you re in the vanguard of progressive thought outside academia and vaush himself very much acknowledges the rampant existence of misandry on the left. he talks about it only from time to time tho and every single time it causes a major shitstorm in chat and the subreddit goes crazy. just look at this comment section. you re the only person i was able to even bring up a real policy suggestion to creation of men s shelters because 99 of my energy here was spent to argue against people who denied or downplayed the existence of men s issues, who demanded that men are at the top and should fix it themselves we re trying to tyvm, we know you re not gonna help and the nastiest ones who actively resorted to personal insults against op and conflating him with the far right. not to be doomer, but i see very few leftists taking this serious. and among them only like 10 aren t men i think. which is quite telling and the reason i think misandry is the main reason for the left s blind spot here. gt it is really nice though to see that it s becoming possible to present as cis and masculine while still dabbling in like .. nail paint, skin hair care, etc lol. it s really unfortunate that what style a cis masculine man is allowed to have is pretty limited a lot. oh for sure! but i think these are two separate issues. men being able to present however they want while still being able to identify not only as men but as masculine as well is important progress. however, some men aren t ready to take this step, some aren t brave enough and need society to change even more and some simply have no interest in this or prefer to present in a traditionally masculine way. particularly the last group is often made to feel like there s something wrong with them, which is why i appreciate that vaush is making it clear that these men can be just as progressive as someone from the lgbt community. it s another one of those blind spots of the left and i think it s not surprising at all that we re losing so many young men to the right. gt where i live, a bunch of dudes got really into wearing kilts xd so skirts don t have to be a feminine thing.. etc etc. if you re scottish i think this counts as traditionally masculine tho haha",reddit,2022-11-30 13:07:53.800685

1146,2022-11-29,00:34:08,"your phrase they claim that it improves their lives seem to refer to the fact that people after transition do report a better quality of life and a happier state of being. for much of psychiatry, self survey is the only rightful measure of a lot of treatments. this is because there has not been invented, nor do i think there ever could be, a device or a method that can measure happiness, nor define it in the material realm. happiness is a subjective experience. we have found material correlations, of course it is by these material correlations that we prescribe any psychiatric medication, or perform treatments of a behavioral disorder. but at the end of the day, the way we tell the efficacy of these methods is by hearing and seeing, with the eyes and ears of a well trained doctor or nurse of course, what the patients do have to say. it is by this we measure a treatment of any dysphoria. your statement that many claim that it improves their lives is, to a clinical perspective, the very empirical data you speak of. cornell university performed a large scale study and review of the efficacy of gender transition treatments for gender dysphoria. you can claim, like a conspiracy theorist, that these universities and all these studies are led by and compromised by political inclinations of the authors. but the authority of scientists in matters of science stands firm. as much as you ask others to not distort the truth to fit their ideologies, you must do the same for yourself. here is the link https whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu topics lgbt equality 20what does the scholarly research say about the well being of transgender people 20 post transition suicide rate is often cited as the refutation against the conclusions of these studies, which are made through sweeping parameters of significance, ranging from self reported mood state to social withdrawal and sleep cycles. but suicide rate is one factor against many, and, most importantly, has an alternative explanation that we have empirical data to support. after transition, the person has to now live as a trans person. a pre transition individual most likely does not experience transphobia, since they do not identify, nor express, that they are transgender. after transition, however, while other parts of their lives may have significantly improved, the hate and disapproval they experience afterwards greatly increase. this, i believe, you will not deny the world we live in is incredibly hostile to trans people. conservative evangelical protestants, for example, actively call for death and elimination of these people. we have seen several anti trans mass violence cases in recent days. the world is not restraining its capacity for hate and malice against these human beings. in a world like this, transitioning means they will change from a person who is accepted by society but suffers from within, to a person who is at peace from within, but suffers externally from society. they have merely replaced one malheur for another. these people more likely than not have to completely overturn and cause upheaval in their familial support, and considering that many of people undergoing transition are youths, this loss is extremely significant. this means that a school aged child could face homelessness and couchsurfing. and many do. a significant portion of trans people, it has been shown, experience multiple hardships that each individually have been known to cause serious depression that can lead to suicide. you saying that post transition suicide rate is still as high is no different from injuring someone who was just treated of an injury, and saying that the treatment did not work because they are still injured. i do acknowledge that this is a very harsh criticism coming from my side. however, i believe that i must not restrain my contention when i am defending what i believe to be right. i can only pray that you would understand me with a generous heart and contemplative humility, both of which are gifts that the lord bestows in his grace. detransition numerically consist of a minority ranging at 0.47 4 depending on the study https www.gendergp.com detransition facts of people who do undergo transition. this is consistent with the rate of misdiagnoses of even the most reliable medical practices. we are allowed to suggest alternative treatments. in fact, one might say that that is our very job, to discover new treatments! and certainly people do evidence based medicine. i don t think anyone denies that evidence based medicine is good. the community of doctors, especially psychiatrists, is actually more skeptical and hostile to transgenderism than not, in anonymous surveys conducted by aap. it is in fact due to the very evidence based medicine you speak of that many doctors begrudgingly accept the dsm.",reddit,2022-11-30 13:07:53.800685

1721,2022-11-28,21:10:35," and who is to decide that their decision was a mistake ? the nazi will always think that outlawing lgbt relationships and abortions is right and anything that disagrees with them is a transgression of their very way of life, you simply cannot convince people who think differently yet refuses to listen who is to decide what everyone else can learn about, think, debate, or speak to based on their own personal hierarchy of values for an open society of 340 million different people from around the world? it s idealization of dictatorship. it s a logical impossibility such a notion could bring equality. beyond this, you didn t think the nazi would come after jews again to 86 them and redistribute their phat loots using the same stereotypes about how they are greedy capitalist archetypes, epitomizing materialism, wealth, profit, and privilege did you? too big of a red flag to be a socialist demonizing capitalists, christians, blacks, jews, and others today following that format. socialists couldn t pull it off and get people to cede their rights and income focusing on jews as the target, it would alarm everyone. the groups their hate and envy leads them to target to control and take money from varies specific to the conditions in their particular country to a large degree. they would target who they see as easy and fashionable to target at the time. blackshirts and brownshirts weren t always well educated, but they managed to be outlandishly elitist as a defining trait just the same. the idea you would get to decide what anyone chooses to learn about, or that you are entitled to make claims for equality of material possession using gov force, guns, prisons, and gallows is where it starts. these parties see equality of income income inequality as the main thing. they seek a fairer distribution of earth s resources. hitler s nazi party ran on environmentalism. control the environment, control the people. control what may be said, control the people. once you try to normalize fanciful faux elitist notions like that, the rest of what socialism, communism, and fascism are known for must follow. to the contrary, hitler introduced abortion to get rid of the undesirables. he believed in the forced evolution of humanity through the death of the handicapped and those he saw as inferior. an arguably similar rationale is often used to justify abortion today specifically, the killing of unborn children who suffer from physical and mental issues, a form of eugenics. adolf hitler declared it could only suit us if girls and women had as many abortions as possible. we must use every means to instill in the population the idea that it is harmful to have several children, the expenses that they cause and the dangerous effect on woman s health it will be necessary to open special institutions for abortions and doctors must be able to help out there in case there is any question of this being a breach of their professional ethics. from 1938 to 1945, this surgical treatment of useless eaters progressed swiftly once normalized, to a more comprehensive solution the eager genocide, by hitler s nazis, of over 11 million people considered to be subhuman or unworthy of life, as is authenticated and documented by the nuremberg trials records. those killed included jews, evangelical christians, blacks, gypsies, communists, homosexuals, amputees and mental patients. this was nothing other than rampant darwinism the elimination of millions of human beings branded unfit inferior by, and for the benefit of, those who regarded themselves as being fit superior . the core idea of darwinism is selection. after world war ii, the war crimes tribunal indicted nazi leaders for encouraging and compelling abortion, which the tribunal considered crimes against humanity. yet in the public discourse, the proliferation of far right talking points has only served to make their position ever stronger, the mere fact of a ben shapiro going onto college campus to absolutely destroy liberal leftists with facts and logic already has closet nazis to cheer all over at the triumph of conservative ideology over progressivism. in fact that s an example of the reverse, and that you think it shows that is ironically the proof. you re confusing and conflating soft terms like conservative and right, which are different in various parts of europe and elsewhere in the world the uk being the closest to american conservatives you can also find socialism, which is inherently radically authoritarian, called right wing for that reason. some of these distinctions are more disparate than others, depending on the countries being compared. like in america. american conservatives are conserving the european liberalism the american polity was founded on. hayek, london school of economics conservatism proper is a legitimate, probably necessary, and certainly widespread attitude of opposition to drastic change. it has, since the french revolution, for a century and a half played an important role in european politics. until the rise of socialism its opposite was liberalism... there is nothing corresponding to this conflict in the history of the united states, because what in europe was called liberalism was here the common tradition on which the american polity had been built thus the defender of the american tradition was a liberal in the european sense. how about you let me know that we are in an enlightened and open society when we get there, meanwhile stopping hate crimes sound like a more pressing issue, and if censorship and an end to free speech stops that, then so be it to the extent we aren t it would be due to the presently overpowered socialist governmental indoctrination system exploiting all of society with class warfare hate speech. as in germany in hitler s time, the socialists love to start them early. adolf hitler your child belongs to me. the joke is the left pretends to concerned with hate crimes, or as republicans call them, crimes. meanwhile, like the nazis and soviets our rocialists seek to release perps and avoid punishing criminals as well as to remove the rule of law through absence of police power or otherwise neutering police power. hitler, for example, did all of these so that criminals would be free on the streets to riot and terrorize the business districts with his brownshirts. what good are civil rights, constitutions, and laws that call crimes hate crimes without anyone around to enforce them? no good whatsoever. we do not believe there could ever exist a state with lasting inner health if it is not built on internal social justice! adolf hitler, why we are anti semites, august 15, 1920 speech in munich at the hofbr uhaus since we are socialists, we must necessarily also be antisemites because we want to fight against the very opposite materialism and mammonism... how can you not be an antisemite, being a socialist! adolf hitler, why we are anti semites, august 15, 1920 speech in munich at the hofbr uhaus mammonism the greedy pursuit of riches, derives from the late latin mammon also mamm nas and mamm na wealth, personification of wealth, from greek mam n s, from aramaic m m n riches, wealth, profit. the heaviest blow that ever struck humanity was the coming of christianity. bolshevism is christianity s illegitimate child. both are inventions of the jew. adolf hitler, 12 july 1941, hitler s table talk christianity is an invention of sick brains. adolf hitler 13 december 1941, hitler s

1852,2022-11-28,20:09:26," gt abdication of duty if parliament leaves 377a issue to the courts shanmugam gt it is the duty of the elected representatives of parliament to deal with thorny social issues, rather than leave it to the courts. gt while the issue of homosexuality is a deeply divisive one, gay people deserve dignity and must not be stigmatised, minister for law and home affairs k shanmugam said in parliament on nov. 28. gt so i say, the time has come for us to remove section 377a, because it humiliates and hurts gay people , he said. gt most gay people do not cause harm to others, they just want to live peacefully and quietly and be accepted as part of society the same as any other singaporean, he added. gt shanmugam also expounded on the legal risks to singapore s laws if parliament abdicates its duty and does not act, and section 377a of the penal code is struck down by the courts in the future. gt historical context for the british law on which 377a is based gt shanmugam said the government had spoken to a wide range of people, including religious leaders and lgbt groups. gt he said that many of those who opposed the 377a repeal were concerned about the consequences, and not because they thought sex between men itself should be criminalised. gt shanmugam said that in repealing 377a, one needs to examine the historical context of the law, the political compromise that has been struck, and the reasons for moving on the appeal now. gt it started with a uk law passed 137 years ago, section 11 of the uk criminal law amendment act. 377a is an almost word for word copy of section 11. gt this was introduced in the uk parliament at 2 30 in the morning, with few other members of parliament present, as a last minute amendment to an unrelated bill, meant to suppress brothels and protect women and girls. that bill had gone through a four year process and already endured a long debate in parliament. gt at this point, member of parliament mp henry labouchere introduced section 11. shanmugam elaborated on how labouchere had a history of introducing wrecking amendments to discredit laws that others had suggested. labouchere could also have been extremely homophobic. gt in any case, the law that was passed covered all sexual acts between men, including between consenting adults. perhaps the mps were tired at the late hour, and just wanted to pass the bill. however, this law in 1885 would go on to impact thousands of lives in the years to come. gt in 1938, the uk attorney general introduced 377a to bring it in line with the uk criminal law, when singapore was still a british colony. gt king henry viii gt shanmugam dug deeper into history, citing the example of the buggery act in the 1500s, during the reign of king henry viii. this criminalised sodomy, but under church laws, not state. gt when henry broke with the church in rome and started the church of england, he converted many of the church s laws into secular laws that were handled by the state. this included the buggery act. gt when you go through this history, into the origins of the offence of sodomy, we see that it was introduced as part of a power struggle between henry and the catholic church, and not because of any view that sodomy per se ought to be criminalised, shanmugam said. gt he cited two other laws, the vagrancy act 1898 and offences against the person act 1861, which were introduced with no deliberation on whether there was a need to criminalise homosexual behaviour. however, they were retained in the law up till the 1950s. gt wolfenden committee gt in 1954, the uk government appointed the wolfenden committee to review laws relating to homosexual offences. gt it was only concerned with whether homosexual behaviour should be dealt with under criminal law, and not about private moral conduct, unless it directly affected the public good. gt it concluded that the function of criminal law was intended to preserve public order and decency, protect the citizens against offence and injury, and provide safeguards against exploitation and corruption of others. gt it was not the purpose of criminal law to intervene in the private lives of citizens, or to enforce any particular pattern of behaviour aside from the three functions. gt the committee said that homosexual acts in public were against the public good, but such acts in private did not warrant intervention from the law. it also accepted that homosexual sex between men could have a damaging act on family life, which shanmugam said was something many singaporeans also believed, and had to be acknowledged. gt however the committee emphasised that while it may be considered immoral, it would not be considered as damaging as criminal offences. therefore it took the position that sex between adult men in private should not be considered a crime. gt northern ireland s opposition gt the public debate on homosexuality in the uk continued. shanmugam noted that while partial decriminalisation of gay sex between consenting adults occurred in 1967, it only applied to the mainland uk and not northern ireland, which was deeply religious and conservative. gt it was only decriminalised in northern ireland in 1982, following a decision from the european court of human rights. however, northern ireland still opposed it and all its mps voted against the law. gt northern ireland s experience shows how a court decision can force a change even though a society is not ready for such change , shanmugam noted. gt division on homosexuality around the world gt shanmugam said that there is a divide in views on homosexuality in the anglican church, and the strong viewpoints show gt first, that even within a single religious community, it is difficult to agree on the right answer, assuming there is one, on the issue of homosexuality. second, that homosexuality is a topic that continues to raise strong viewpoints. third, that if we do not handle this carefully, homosexuality can be a deeply divisive issue even among those who share a common belief. gt shanmugam cited the examples of the u.s. and italy, where even though sex between men has been decriminalised, society still remains divided over the issue. gt he added international reporting may gloss over these differences and not understand that such issues need to be dealt with sensitively, with understanding, and they may portray that anyone who has a negative view of male homosexuality is a bigot. gt shanmugam shared some statistics that showed there is a growing international trend towards decriminalising homosexual acts between consenting adult men. but he also said gt in singapore, we look carefully at international trends but we don t simply follow such trends. we chart our own path based on what we believe is in our own best interests. and we are very clear to foreign governments and companies, that these are political, social, and moral choices for singaporeans to decide, and that they should not interfere. gt singapore s history on 377a debate gt in 2007, 377a was substantively debated in parliament for the first time. gt prime minister lee hsien loong spoke and stated the government s position singaporeans as a whole remained largely conservative, and supported stable heterosexual families, but there was growing science based evidence that sexual orientation is substantially inborn. gt while gay people have a place in society and are entitled to private lives, there are different views in society as to whether homosexuality was acceptable or moral. lgbt advocacy should not set the tone for the rest of singapore society, and the government would try to maintain a balance. 377a would be retained but not pro actively enforced. gt shanmugam remarked it was a very singaporean way of dealing with the situation which best fitted society at the time. gt pm lee said that if the issue was forced , it would divide and polarise society and lead to even less space for the gay community in singapore. therefore, it was better to let the situation evolve gradually. gt it was a compromise. it was better. and it has worked for singapore in the past 15 years. we managed to maintain some harmony while many other societies have become deeply divided on these issues for the same period, shanmugam said. gt why repeal now gt shanmugam said there are two main reasons why the government is moving now on repeal. gt first, society is now more ready for the repeal, and it is the right thing to do. second, there is a significant legal risk that the courts will strike down 377a if it is left alone. gt repealing 377a is the right thing to do as it hurts the gay community gt shanmugam said that while homosexuality is considered a sin in some religions, not all sins are considered crimes. gt in singapore, like in many other places, it is generally not the function of criminal law to intervene in the private lives of citizens, he said. gt even if 377a is repealed, other laws remain in place that criminalise non consensual sexual acts between men, sexual acts against young persons, a serious act regardless of consent, and sexual acts between two men in public. these serve to protect society. gt however, consensual sex between two adult men in private does not raise law and order concerns. gt the time has come for us to remove section 377a. it humiliates and hurts gay people. most gay people do not cause harm to others. they just want to live peacefully and quietly and be accepted as part of society the same as any other singaporean. gt they are our family, our friends, our colleagues. they deserve dignity, respect, acceptance. they do not deserve to be stigmatised because of their sexual orientation. gt to a gay person, even if 377a is not enforced, it is memorialised in the law, like a sword hanging over their heads. it is a reminder that even in the privacy of their bedrooms, they may be",reddit,2022-11-30 13:07:53.800685

1937,2022-11-28,19:16:06," gt i made this decision with a heavy heart wp mps split on whether to support 377a repeal gt taking advantage of the party s whip being lifted, workers party s wp members of parliament mp dennis tan, gerald giam, sylvia lim, and leon perera offered differing opinions on bills related to the repeal of 377a on nov. 28. gt leader of the opposition and wp chief pritam singh had earlier voiced his support both for the repeal of the anti gay law and an accompanying amendment to the constitution to protect the definition of marriage. gt of the other wp mps that spoke in parliament on the same day, only perera held the same position as singh. gt tan and giam both did not support repealing 377a, while lim stated that she would abstain from voting on the constitutional amendment. gt dennis tan, gerald giam faisal manap reject repeal gt however, tan, mp for hougang, said that he found it difficult to support the repeal, citing feedback he had received from singaporeans concerned about the removal of a symbolic social marker . gt many expressed concerns that the removal of such a marker may make it difficult for parents in setting down their family and social values at home, said tan. gt many are also concerned that they will be stopped from expressing their contrary views on sexuality after the repeal including the fear of being cancelled. some are concerned that there will be name calling because they take a view on sexuality in their workplace or for young people and children, in their schools. gt guided by his own faith and beliefs, tan said he was personally troubled by the repeal of 377a. gt referencing his good friends in the lgbt community, tan asked for their understanding as he made the most difficult decision of his political career. gt likewise, giam stated that he did not support the repeal, citing his belief that it was in the best long term interests of our nation . gt it is my sincere belief that retaining section 377a without enforcing it provides the best balance of the conflicting interests in our society. gt while aljunied grc mp professed that he was not prejudiced against members of the lgbt community, he acknowledged that his position was not universally popular. gt i have been told in my face by a constituent that he will not vote for me in future because of my stand on this issue, said giam. gt i accept the importance that many singaporeans place on their elected mps positions on these bills, to the extent that it will be a factor in their decision at the polls. gt yet, giam said he hoped that singaporeans would refrain from turning into single issue voters. gt there are too many important issues that affect the lives of singaporeans for one s vote to be decided based on this single issue, he said. gt faisal manap, who was not in parliament due to a covid 19 infection, also disagreed with the repeal, said singh in his speech. gt sylvia lim abstains from voting on constitutional amendment gt in her speech on nov. 28, lim tackled technicalities related to the proposed constitutional amendment of article 156, stating from the outset that she supported the repeal of 377a. gt with regard to articles 156 1 and 2 which set out parliament and the government s authority to, among other responsibilities, safeguard and define the institution of marriage lim questioned if either added anything new to the current constitution. gt next, she zoned in on articles 156 3 and 4 . gt both were written in reference to the fundamental liberties protected in singapore s constitution and lim stated that she was concerned by their implications on judicial oversight of parliament and the government. gt to now include the definition of marriage as something that the courts cannot assess for constitutionality does not appear to me to be justified, she said, clarifying that she was not advocating for gay marriages. gt from a governance standpoint, i find this position very difficult to accept. gt lim, therefore, concluded by saying that she was casting a vote of abstention on the constitutional amendment bill. in contrast, giam, tan, and perera stated their support for the bill. gt leon perera supports both repeal constitutional amendment gt in addition, perera voiced his support for the repeal of 377a, given that it was not actively enforced. gt to keep a law that has a serious impact on the lives of many singaporeans on the basis that it is a marker but will not be enforced by the current government is not, in my opinion, how we should go about making good laws, said perera. gt he further cited his personal conviction that individuals should be treated equally regardless of sexual orientation. gt however, perera argued that freedom of speech protected by the constitution should continue to be extended to those who respectfully question lgbtq relationships on the grounds of religion. gt can we move forward by respectfully agreeing to disagree without demonizing the one we disagree with but embracing him and her as our fellow citizen, our colleague, our brother and our sister? asked perera. gt i think we must. i don t know for a fact that we can or will. but from the discussions i have had with my workers party colleagues who have expressed or will express different views from mine in parliament today, i would like to say that i am optimistic that singapore can do it. gt related stories gt top image from mci s youtube channel 1.0.2 source code https github.com fterh sneakpeek contribute https github.com fterh sneakpeek ",reddit,2022-11-30

2525,2022-11-28,11:42:23," gt why do we want privacy when taking a piss? my best guess is evolution. we re vulnerable while we go to the bathroom, and the desire for privacy is essentially a desire to be in a closed controlled environment. privacy is all about not wanting to be seen or watched, and being seen and watched is exactly how you die in prehistoric life. you re arguing that our desire for privacy is illogical, and maybe shouldn t be respected because of that. but that s wholly irrelevant. all desires are illogical. logically, why should we reproduce? fall in love? eat delicious food? none of it has any actual logical basis for why it should be something we do. there are easy explanations for most of these via evolution we have evolved to stay alive eating food, sleeping, etc and we ve evolved to reproduce, and the human strategy for reproduction is primarily one man and one woman in a long term relationship to raise offspring. there are many exceptions to this, most obviously lgbt people, but that doesn t mean the rule doesn t hold for most people. in gay people they have the same desires for companionship as straight people do, it s just directed at their own sex. is that bad? evolutionarily speaking, maybe? but who gives a shit what evolution wants? nobody. we only should care about the things that actually effect us, and privacy is something we desire so we should have it. if you abolished privacy, maybe that would be better. but it would also mean going against a pretty innate human trait. so why would you? why not just go along with it when it s convenient? it s not like the desire for privacy actually causes problems. it allows for people to get away with things, yes, because privacy is the reason we don t want a surveillance state, but there are pragmatic reasons to not want a surveillance state, such as the fact that we cannot guarantee that the state is benevolent and competent. gt and the agurement of i dont want people to see me poop is irreverent. this argument is not irrelevant . it is, in fact, the only argument that matters. we give people privacy because they want it. end of discussion.",reddit,2022-11-30 13:07:53.800685

your marriage are exactly like mine, but we have a lot in common. my wife and i are about your age. i grew up with undiagnosed autism and a lot of attachment trauma, especially with my father. he is a hateful, narcissistic, bigoted person. he s basically a walking tradcon stereotype, and thus i grew up being taught that lgbt is mental illness and kink is weird and taboo. i had few dates and friendships. i suffered a lot from gender dysphoria that i repressed. i married my wife, whom i deeply love and adore in many ways, over a decade ago. she s very kind to me and she s a wonderful mother to our child. the first time i got to know an actual trans person, about five years ago, i almost immediately knew that i was like them, and within some months, i began to medically transition, and now living full time , i have absolutely no regrets. coming out and transitioning is one of the best things i ever did for myself, but it also hurt like hell to go thru that process with someone who loved me and was attached to the notion of me being male. eventually, we got to the point where i feel safe being myself again with my wife, or so i thought... once i began to engage with the queer community, i became more and more curious about bdsm. i know that even before then, i had read a bit about bdsm because something about it just fascinated and terrified me. i obsessed over it, and then it sort of faded into the background for a while until i eventually started asking my wife to try topping me with some kinky stuff, and she said that it wasn t her thing, but she d try it for my sake. i was honestly instantly hooked. i remember that the first kinky toy i played with was a wax play candle and when we were done, i didn t want to throw it away because it felt so special to me, and i still have it in my possession. she, on the other hand, said to me, if i knew you would ask for this, i would not have married you. some months later, it became apparent to me that this wasn t working. she was just going thru the motions and i wanted to try doing some of these things with people who actually wanted to experience these things. a few years ago, i started visiting my local bdsm club. at first, everything was fascinating and exciting, aside from the fact that finding play partners has been very hit and miss. i honestly envy people who have regular play partners. fast forward to today, and i m honestly as miserable as i ever was over this situation. i m miserable because i realize that i want to share a bond and a relationship and love with the people i play with, and i already told my wife that i didn t want that, and frankly, i hate having to avoid doing something that my wife would consider sex . it honestly really sucks to the point that sometimes, i wish i had never heard of bdsm. i want this to be part of my life and not just something that i do late at night at this place across town from where i live. i feel like this is the one part of my life where i theoretically could be seen and cherished as the person i really am and not for the person i thought i was when i got married, even tho i would argue that i am a much better human than i was when i got married. the long and the short of it is that after several weeks of extreme anxiety and self loathing and realizing that these urges are never, ever going away, barring medical castration or suicide, i came to the conclusion that to remain with my wife, i need a more open relationship, and i am honestly scared to death of expressing this wish for a number of reasons. i honestly really love and admire my wife for the good things she does and for the virtues she personifies, but i am totally miserable over not having something that just becomes an ever more all consuming obsession the more i wish it wasn t true. i would have preferred for my wife s sake that i wasn t trans, that i could have been happy to be a man, and i wish that i could have been happy to be vanilla for the same reason. at this point, i feel like the person whom i act as around my wife is, in many ways, like a mask that is peeling off my face. she is simply a collection of habits and behaviors that i continue to display because i believe that my wife expects them from me. this situation is completely untenable to me. i said to a friend that i feel like the notion of being happy in my life as it is is like the notion of being happy in prison. a prisoner might be happy when she feels like things are going as well as they can for her in prison, and she might experience vicarious happiness for people she loves outside of prison, but prison is not a place for happiness. i don t want to say that you are exactly like me, but i seem to be further down the same road you re on and i m in a very

2655,2022-11-28,10:19:35,the free loving christianity of today is influenced by the hippie movement of the 70 s. if its all love and chill then why tf should anyone follow it. i do not find a god who created hell worthy of worship nor do i believe a religion that says you will be saved by simply believing in god or not. that is such a dumb criteria if u think about it. also your idea of manliness is so strange. is manliness not caring about minority groups such as the lgbt. forget manliness where is the humanity. we should have empathy and care about others to be good people. do you really think gay people will leave the religion just for lust. leaving the religion is such a hard thing. you also insinuate that gay people don t have goals but they do have all the same goals as anyone else and wish to just be able to have the right to them like straight people.,reddit,2022-11-30 13:07:53.800685

2695,2022-11-28,09:59:16,"okay, i ve taken the time to read the articles and i ll respond as calmly and politely as i can because i m happy to have someone who is engaging with me rather than just insulting or down voting. the first article, everyone referenced explicitly condemned the violence. i get your perspective, but i don t share it. let me give a flip side parallel that might make this make sense. let s say, hypothetically, the head of the nra got assassinated, i wouldn t suddenly hold the people who advocate for stronger gun control responsible for the murder. i understand that you can be against the second amendment and argue that the second amendment leads to dead children without thinking you expressing those views i disagree with caused a murder. in the same way, as someone who enjoys drag shows, i think it s reasonable that conservative express their discomfort or outrage at children being exposed to drag without being blamed for a psychotic murderer. the fact that they explicitly condemned the actions is enough for me. the second article says he s the grandson of a republican lawmaker he hasn t been in touch with for over a decade, and that makes me feel that drawing that as a cause isn t reasonable to me. i d actually have to see exactly how he supported the january 6th riot to decide my opinion on him as a legislator as well. i know plenty of people who supported a peaceful protest over the elections who were furious that it turned into a riot who are now slandered for supporting the riot. if he supported the violence of january 6th, he should be impeached. i just don t think that link has value given their estrangement referenced in the article. as for the third article, walker is a piece of shit. even the people who voted for him don t disagree there, but if i recall, his opponent is also pretty fucking vile. i have general distaste for people using decisive rhetoric like calling your fellow countrymen the enemy. i can condemn such behavior without qualification, but i do think it is worth noting that the people on the left calling anyone who supports conservatives fascists or nazis are just as bad and are every bit as culpable for people who riot because of the charged language. i think that shit all needs to stop so we can find common ground and understanding to make our society start functioning before we drive of the cliff that is getting ever closer. as for the left hating each other, that s true of much of the right as well. neocons, magas, tradcons, and a few other groups really don t like each other. when i say the left is more collectivist, i m talking ideologically and not about unity. the left s attitude that everyone needed to get vaccinated for the sake of others is a collectivist argument. the right s attitude that each person had to change their behavior based upon their risk tolerance is an individualistic attitude. that schism seems to be the biggest ideological difference between the two sides of the nation. i m rather centrist. i think that exposing children to more mild forms of sexualized entertainment is a problem. i do find drag queen story hour bizarre. i also find all age drag shows distasteful because i went to one and found it to be unacceptable how sexualized it was. i feel the same way about kink at pride. this is coming from a bisexual dude who was involved with the occupy protests in my younger years. i spouted some pretty hash rhetoric against the bankers in those days, but i never supported the protestors who threw bricks and started violence. i think we need to acknowledge more nuance. i m not at all against the lgbt being that i fall under that umbrella, but i am against over sexualization. i also see conservatives who hold a view like mine being called homophobic or transphobic, and that rhetoric doesn t help.",reddit,2022-11-30 13:07:53.800685

2741,2022-11-28,09:38:13,"i recently watched the spider man movies for the first time and that s got me interested in doing a superhero world of my own. but my world is rather different instead of being an alternate earth, it s an alternate version of the world i created, and so are subjected to the culture of it. this has massive ramifications as the idea of superheroes in our modern understanding is of individuals achieving great feats and individual glory, neatly fitting into the western individualistic culture but the culture it takes place in, namely the tazhar culture of the 6th tazhar isshad, is a largely collectivist culture, especially when it comes to individual s bodies and by extension their physical prowesses. so in this world superheroes are not representations of individual achievers but instead collective tools for order often owned by the government or other authorities. but their is another type of superheroes, one that are based on individual ideas, but are much more spiritual and metaphorical than literal individuals. these are of individual vigilantes who fight for and to promote a cause and more so hold a title rather than that thing being part of their personal identity, allowing the title to be passed on to other individuals whilst still remaining the same superhero. i said spiritual earlier as these type of heroes represent individual ideas rather than persons which is exactly how the religious beliefs of the tazhrim work, as in there is the main religion and worship of the sun as a god, a sort of higher tier god, but below that are millions of saints or spirits who represent individual things or ideas, and so the heroes are more so physical representation of the spirits. like one hero i thought of is a hero who represents the youth and progression and liberalism, their design is of everything currently changing in society, such as the country trying to move on from the rigid and conservative and nazi paralleled 5th tazhar isshad and society s push to move away from that and the rapid societal changes occurring, forefront for the youth being equality for minorities, namely women and the lgbt and breaking society s rigid rules that it has stuck by for centuries and has cause suffering unto others by this is definitely influenced by earth western s societal issues and changes this is emulated in their design and clothing choice often breaking traditional gender norms and more gender ambiguous look like one iteration of the hero is of a yet to be named male youth where he wears a quite skin tight suit a just general standard clothing choice amongst heroes but with clothing over it, that specific clothing being of either baggy sweatpants or loose and long shorts and a puffy jacket on top maybe overtop a crop top, his design is still not definite . to a western viewer this may not be seen as anything revolutionary, but to a tazhrim viewer that would be incredibly rebellious for standard male outfit the legs are often very exposed and shown, while for women it is very taboo to do so, and so baggy pants and non form fitting lower garments that cover up more of the legs are a very feminine thing to wear, and so a man to do so is very rebellious and new reverse goes with the top of the body where for men the top is often covered and more baggy while for women more is allowed to be shown, and so crop tops are a very feminine thing, and have in the modern times been a thing amongst queer men and the youth, and so wearing that is another sign of modern times, but the baggy jacket worn harkens back to the fact he is a man, as it s a very masculine thing to wear. and one thing to know is how flawed the people who play the heroes are, they are not moral paragons of the perfect person, even if their public image is of that the individuals are often petty and greedy and short minded, abusing their power to get person wealth and benefits, more so in the government heroes. also another thing to keep in mind is that none of these have superpowers or anything unnatural like our world s super man and spider man and thor and such, they are all relatively normal homo sapiens tsameraensises, either being extremely trained in a certain skill or having the help of technology.",reddit,2022-11-30 13:07:53.800685
